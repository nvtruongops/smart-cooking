## Region Migration Support

### ✅ Multi-Region Deployment Capability

**Supported Regions:**
- ✅ us-east-1 (N. Virginia) - Full support
- ✅ ap-southeast-1 (Singapore) - With cross-region Bedrock

**Key Implementations:**
- [x] Dynamic region configuration via environment variables
- [x] Cross-region Bedrock support for regions without AI services
- [x] Region-aware S3 URL generation
- [x] CloudFront SSL certificate handling (us-east-1 requirement)
- [x] Deployment scripts for both regions
- [x] Performance monitoring for cross-region operations

**Files Created:**
- `docs/REGION-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive migration guide
- `docs/AP-SOUTHEAST-1-CHECKLIST.md` - Deployment checklist
- `scripts/deploy-ap-southeast-1.sh` - Linux/Mac deployment script
- `scripts/Deploy-ApSoutheast1.ps1` - Windows PowerShell script
- `config/ap-southeast-1.env` - Environment configuration

**Performance Impact (ap-southeast-1):**
- AI operations: +1.5-2s latency (cross-region Bedrock calls)
- Database operations: No change (same region)
- Additional cost: <$1/month for cross-region data transfer

**Usage:**
```bash
# Deploy to ap-southeast-1
source config/ap-southeast-1.env
./scripts/deploy-ap-southeast-1.sh

# Or use PowerShell on Windows
.\scripts\Deploy-ApSoutheast1.ps1 -Environment prod
```
