# Complete Migration to ap-southeast-1 - Strategic Plan

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Objective:** Migrate Smart Cooking MVP completely to ap-southeast-1 for simplified architecture  
**Status:** PLANNING PHASE

---

## üéØ **Migration Objectives**

### Primary Goals
1. **Simplify Architecture** - Single region deployment
2. **Reduce Operational Complexity** - Easier management
3. **Optimize Costs** - Eliminate all cross-region costs
4. **Improve Performance** - Consistent regional latency
5. **Enhance Control** - Single source of truth

### Expected Benefits
- **Architecture:** Single region, no cross-region complexity
- **Performance:** Consistent low latency across all services
- **Cost:** Additional $5-10/month savings (eliminate remaining cross-region)
- **Operations:** Simplified monitoring, backup, disaster recovery

---

## üìä **Current State Analysis**

### Services Currently in us-east-1
1. **CloudFront SSL Certificates** - ‚ùå **CANNOT MOVE** (AWS requirement)
2. **Test Environment** - ‚úÖ **CAN MOVE** (optional)
3. **Legacy Deployment Scripts** - ‚úÖ **ALREADY UPDATED**
4. **Documentation References** - ‚úÖ **MOSTLY UPDATED**

### Services Already in ap-southeast-1
1. **DynamoDB** - ‚úÖ Primary deployment region
2. **Lambda Functions** - ‚úÖ With dynamic Bedrock config
3. **API Gateway** - ‚úÖ Regional deployment
4. **S3 Buckets** - ‚úÖ Regional buckets
5. **Cognito** - ‚úÖ Regional user pools
6. **CloudFront Distribution** - ‚úÖ Global (origin in ap-southeast-1)

---

## üöÄ **Migration Strategy**

### Phase 1: Complete Source Code Standardization ‚úÖ DONE
- [x] Update deployment scripts to use ap-southeast-1 Bedrock
- [x] Update configuration files
- [x] Update documentation

### Phase 2: Test Environment Migration (OPTIONAL)
```typescript
// Current test setup
process.env.BEDROCK_REGION = 'us-east-1';
process.env.AWS_REGION = 'us-east-1';

// Proposed change
process.env.BEDROCK_REGION = 'ap-southeast-1';
process.env.AWS_REGION = 'ap-southeast-1';
```

**Benefits:**
- Consistent test/production regions
- Better integration testing
- Simplified CI/CD configuration

**Risks:**
- Potential test failures if region-specific differences
- Need to update CI/CD environment variables

### Phase 3: Default Script Values Update
```bash
# Update default regions in scripts:
# scripts/validate-deployment.sh
AWS_REGION="ap-southeast-1"  # Changed from us-east-1

# scripts/deploy-infrastructure.sh  
AWS_REGION="ap-southeast-1"  # Changed from us-east-1

# scripts/deploy-frontend.sh
AWS_REGION="ap-southeast-1"  # Changed from us-east-1
```

### Phase 4: Documentation Cleanup
- Remove all us-east-1 references except CloudFront SSL
- Update architecture diagrams
- Simplify deployment guides

---

## üîí **What CANNOT Be Migrated**

### CloudFront SSL Certificates
```bash
# MUST ALWAYS REMAIN:
export CERTIFICATE_REGION=us-east-1  # ‚ùå AWS REQUIREMENT
```

**Reason:** AWS CloudFront global service requirement  
**Impact:** Minimal - certificates are managed automatically  
**Solution:** Keep this as the ONLY us-east-1 dependency

---

## üìù **Detailed Migration Steps**

### Step 1: Update Test Environment (Optional)
```typescript
// File: test/setup.ts
// BEFORE:
process.env.BEDROCK_REGION = 'us-east-1';
process.env.AWS_REGION = 'us-east-1';

// AFTER:
process.env.BEDROCK_REGION = 'ap-southeast-1';
process.env.AWS_REGION = 'ap-southeast-1';
```

```typescript
// File: tests/performance/optimization-validation.test.ts
// BEFORE:
process.env.AWS_REGION = 'us-east-1';

// AFTER:
process.env.AWS_REGION = 'ap-southeast-1';
```

### Step 2: Update Default Script Values
```bash
# scripts/validate-deployment.sh
# BEFORE:
AWS_REGION="us-east-1"

# AFTER:
AWS_REGION="ap-southeast-1"
```

```bash
# scripts/deploy-infrastructure.sh
# BEFORE:
AWS_REGION="us-east-1"

# AFTER:
AWS_REGION="ap-southeast-1"
```

```bash
# scripts/deploy-frontend.sh
# BEFORE:
AWS_REGION="us-east-1"

# AFTER:
AWS_REGION="ap-southeast-1"
```

```powershell
# scripts/deploy-frontend.ps1
# BEFORE:
[string]$Region = "us-east-1"

# AFTER:
[string]$Region = "ap-southeast-1"
```

### Step 3: Update Documentation References
```markdown
# Remove outdated references like:
- "Cross-region calls to us-east-1 for AI services"
- "Performance impact: +180-250ms latency for AI operations"

# Replace with:
- "Local Bedrock in ap-southeast-1 for optimal performance"
- "Consistent regional architecture for all services"
```

### Step 4: Simplify Architecture Diagrams
- Remove cross-region arrows
- Show single-region deployment
- Highlight CloudFront SSL as only us-east-1 dependency

## üß™ **Testing Strategy**

### Pre-Migration Testing
1. **Update test environment** to ap-southeast-1
2. **Run full test suite** to ensure compatibility
3. **Test deployment scripts** with new defaults
4. **Validate CI/CD pipelines** work with new regions

### Migration Testing
1. **Deploy to staging** with updated configuration
2. **Performance testing** - verify <3s AI generation
3. **Integration testing** - all services working
4. **Cost monitoring** - verify additional savings

### Post-Migration Validation
1. **Monitor CloudWatch metrics** for 48 hours
2. **Verify cost reduction** in billing dashboard
3. **User acceptance testing** - no performance degradation
4. **Documentation review** - ensure accuracy

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risks and Mitigation**

### Risk 1: Test Environment Changes
**Risk:** Tests might fail with region change  
**Mitigation:** 
- Test in isolated environment first
- Keep rollback option available
- Update CI/CD gradually

### Risk 2: Hidden us-east-1 Dependencies
**Risk:** Undiscovered hardcoded references  
**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive code search before migration
- Staged deployment approach
- Monitoring during migration

### Risk 3: Performance Differences
**Risk:** Region-specific service behavior  
**Mitigation:**
- Performance testing in staging
- Gradual rollout
- Rollback plan ready
