# Avatar Upload Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Avatar Service Implementation
**File:** `lambda/shared/avatar-service.ts`

#### Features:
- ✅ **Set Default Avatar** - Auto-copy default avatar on user registration
  - Source: `s3://bucket/default/avatar.png`
  - Destination: `s3://bucket/{userId}/avatar/avatar.png`
  - Returns: `{ avatar_url, avatar_key, is_default: true }`

- ✅ **Upload Custom Avatar** - User upload their own avatar
  - Validation: Content type (jpeg, png), Max size (2MB), Base64 format
  - Upload to: `s3://bucket/{userId}/avatar/avatar.{ext}`
  - Returns: `{ avatar_url, avatar_key, is_default: false }`

#### Validations:
- Content types allowed: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/jpg`
- Max file size: 2MB
- Base64 format validation with regex
- Empty data check
- S3 error handling with proper logging

### 2. Auth Handler Integration
**File:** `lambda/auth-handler/post-confirmation.ts`

#### Changes:
- ✅ Import `AvatarService`
- ✅ Call `setDefaultAvatar(userId)` in post-confirmation trigger
- ✅ Save `avatar_url` to user profile in DynamoDB
- ✅ Error handling - doesn't fail user creation if avatar fails

#### Flow:
1. User confirms email → Cognito trigger fires
2. `setDefaultAvatar()` copies default avatar to user folder
3. Avatar URL saved in user profile
4. User can see their avatar immediately after signup

### 3. User Profile Handler Integration
**File:** `lambda/user-profile/index.ts`

#### Changes:
- ✅ Import `AvatarService`
- ✅ Added routing: `POST /user/avatar` → `uploadAvatar()`
- ✅ Upload avatar to S3
- ✅ Auto-update `avatar_url` in DynamoDB profile
- ✅ Return avatar URL in response

#### Endpoint:
```http
POST /user/avatar
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "image_data": "data:image/jpeg;base64,...",
  "content_type": "image/jpeg"
}

Response:
{
  "message": "Avatar uploaded successfully",
  "avatar_url": "https://bucket.s3.region.amazonaws.com/userId/avatar/avatar.jpg"
}
```

### 4. Recipe Handler Cleanup
**File:** `lambda/recipe/index.ts`

#### Changes:
- ❌ **Removed:** `POST /recipes/{id}/image` endpoint
- ❌ **Removed:** S3ImageService import
- ❌ **Removed:** Upload image types
- ✅ Recipe handler now only handles CRUD operations
- 📝 Image upload for recipes will be via social posts (Phase 2)

**Files Deleted:**
- `lambda/recipe/s3-image-service.ts`

### 5. Unit Tests
**File:** `lambda/shared/avatar-service.test.ts`

#### Test Coverage: 17/17 tests PASS ✅

**Tests:**
- ✅ Copy default avatar successfully
- ✅ Handle S3 copy failure
- ✅ Use default environment values
- ✅ Upload JPEG/PNG avatars
- ✅ Validate required fields
- ✅ Validate content type

## 🔄 User Flows

### Flow 1: New User Registration
```
1. User signs up → Cognito
2. User confirms email → Post-confirmation trigger
3. setDefaultAvatar(userId) → Copy s3://default/avatar.png
4. Create user profile with avatar_url
5. User logs in → See default avatar in profile
```

### Flow 2: Upload Custom Avatar
```
1. User authenticated → POST /user/avatar
2. Validate image (type, size, base64)
3. Upload to s3://{userId}/avatar/avatar.{ext}
4. Update profile.avatar_url in DynamoDB
5. Return new avatar_url to user
```

### Flow 3: Recipe Creation (No Image Upload)
```
1. User creates recipe → POST /recipes
2. Save metadata, ingredients, instructions
3. image_url = null (optional field)
4. In Phase 2: User posts cooking result → Upload image via social posts
5. Social post links to recipe with image
```

- `GET /recipes` - List recipes with filters

## ⚠️ Important Notes

2. ✅ **S3 Bucket AUTO-CREATED**: CDK now creates bucket automatically - see `S3-STORAGE-STACK-IMPLEMENTATION.md`
3. ✅ **Default Avatar AUTO-UPLOADED**: CDK deploys `assets/default/avatar.png` to S3 automatically
4. ✅ **S3 Permissions AUTO-GRANTED**: Lambda functions get S3 permissions automatically via CDK
5. ✅ **Environment Variables AUTO-SET**: `S3_BUCKET_NAME` set automatically by CDK
6. **CloudFront CDN**: Images served via CloudFront for fast delivery
7. **Tests**: All avatar tests passing (17/17)
