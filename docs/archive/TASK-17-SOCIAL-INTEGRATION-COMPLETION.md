## API Endpoints Added

### Posts
- `GET /users/{userId}/posts` - Get user's posts with privacy filtering

### Recipes
- `GET /recipes/{id}/friends-cooked` - Get friends who cooked this recipe

### Cooking History
- `GET /users/{userId}/cooking-history` - Get user's cooking history with privacy filtering

## Database Queries

### User Posts Query
```typescript
// Query user's posts using GSI1
IndexName: 'GSI1'
KeyConditionExpression: 'GSI1PK = :pk AND begins_with(GSI1SK, :sk)'
ExpressionAttributeValues: {
  ':pk': `USER#${targetUserId}`,
  ':sk': 'POST#'
}
ScanIndexForward: false // Newest first
```

### Friends Who Cooked Query
```typescript
// 1. Get user's friends
KeyConditionExpression: 'PK = :pk AND begins_with(SK, :sk)'
FilterExpression: '#status = :status'
ExpressionAttributeValues: {
  ':pk': `USER#${userId}`,
  ':sk': 'FRIEND#',
  ':status': 'accepted'
}

// 2. For each friend, check cooking history
KeyConditionExpression: 'PK = :pk AND begins_with(SK, :sk)'
FilterExpression: 'recipe_id = :recipeId AND #status = :status'
ExpressionAttributeValues: {
  ':pk': `USER#${friendId}`,
  ':sk': 'COOKING#',
  ':recipeId': recipeId,
  ':status': 'completed'
}
```

## Privacy Filtering

### Post Visibility Rules
- **Public posts**: Visible to everyone
- **Friends-only posts**: Visible to accepted friends only
- **Private posts**: Visible to owner only

### Cooking History Visibility
- Controlled by user's privacy settings
- Default: Friends can see cooking history
- Filtered through privacy middleware

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **User Profile**:
   - View own profile → Should see all posts and cooking history
   - View friend's profile → Should see public and friends-only content
   - View stranger's profile → Should only see public content

2. **Recipe Sharing**:
   - Click "Share to Feed" on recipe page
   - Verify post form pre-filled with recipe data
   - Check post count updates after sharing

3. **Cooking History Sharing**:
   - Complete cooking session with rating >= 4
   - Verify auto-suggestion banner appears
   - Share to feed and verify post created
   - Check cooking history displays on profile

### Integration Testing
```typescript
// Test user posts endpoint
GET /users/{userId}/posts
- Verify privacy filtering
- Check pagination works
- Validate post data structure

// Test friends who cooked
GET /recipes/{recipeId}/friends-cooked
- Verify only friends returned
- Check data includes ratings
- Validate sorting by date

// Test cooking history endpoint
GET /users/{userId}/cooking-history
- Verify privacy filtering
- Check only completed sessions shown
- Validate data structure
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- Posts query uses GSI1 for efficient user-based lookups
- Friends who cooked query limited to 10 friends to avoid overload
- Cooking history limited to 10 items on profile
- Post count cached in recipe metadata (future enhancement)

### Potential Improvements
1. Add caching for frequently accessed user posts
2. Implement post count as a denormalized field in recipe metadata
3. Add pagination for friends who cooked list
4. Consider using DynamoDB Streams to update post counts in real-time
